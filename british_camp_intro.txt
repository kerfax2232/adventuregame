You've arrived at the British camp.  It turns out these Brits seem to love
admiring their cool muskets and talking about British things, like how India
will always be under the banner of the king than paying attention to their
camp security.

You slip into a British wardrobe and do your best British accent.  Luckily,
you're mix of Boston sound and British sound matches how the Brits used to sound 
back then.

"'Ello," you greet one general.  "I'm the uh...guest you've been waiting for."

"Oh, really," the general responds"  What's the password? You get 2 guesses"

Remember: it's a number between 1 and 5.
