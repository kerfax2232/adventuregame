You've managed to retrieve the map and bring it back to the General,
and as you know, future first President of the United States.

After returning the map to General Washington, you go to sleep for the night.  You
awake back in your bed, South Park still playing on your phone because apparently
Hulu has never decided to automatically stop playing videos for hours upon hours.

Your efforts have helped win the war.  With troop movements of the British now
known, the army of the 13 colonies are able to plot, plan, and successfully
out-maneuver the British troops.

While I hope it wasn't as difficultin playing as it was in making, 
I do hope it was as much fun to play as it was to make.  Thank you
for your time, and thank you for the opportunity to try something
completely new.
