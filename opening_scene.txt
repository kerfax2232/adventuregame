December, 1778.  You've awoken in a snow-covered tent, bitter cold.
Nothing is right.  You were sleeping only just a second ago in your 
warm bed with your phone streaming South Park from Hulu because
apparently you can't sleep without lights and noise.

"Get up you scallywag," shouts a man in a white wig and military uniform. "Time to
talk to the General."

You walk over to a tent.  You've seen this person before, but only on your money and
in pictures.  It's George Washington.  Because why not?  This is a game for
Gravity Payments, not everything needs to be explained -- your code just has to work.

"Private, we need you to go on a mission for us," begins George Washington.
"You must tell no one what is said here right now."

Confused, you see only three possible responses:
I'm actually Canadian.
Ok, I'm in.
I just want to sleep.

Which will you choose?  The fate of America depends on your answer.

Type in any of the following (in all lowercase letters):
canadian
i'm in
sleep
