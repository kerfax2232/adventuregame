"Too bad, Private," George Washington barks, 
"Did you really think you could exit this strange
game/fantasy with one answer?  You have some
programming skills to try to show off.  Besides,
you're going to go and win this war for us."

"You'll be travelling to a British encampment," he 
continues.  "By any means at your disposal get into
the camp.  Some existing spies tell us they're awaiting
a covert agent from Britain.  No one knows him other
than a number between 1 and 5.  Give the correct number
and they will give you papers regarding their troop 
movements.  Get those papers back to us"

"Wow, only a 5-digit code?" You think to yourself.

Given no choice, you head out to the camp...
